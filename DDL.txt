# DDL
-----
Data Definition Language (DDL) is used to define, modify, and remove schema objects (such as tables, views, indexes, etc.) in the database.
DDL commands are auto-committed, meaning that changes become permanent immediately after execution.
The primary DDL commands include CREATE, ALTER, DROP, and TRUNCATE.

1. CREATE 
------------------
Purpose:
Creates new database objects such as tables.

Syntax:
------
CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column1 datatype [constraint],
    column2 datatype [constraint],
    ...
    CONSTRAINT constraint_name PRIMARY KEY (column1 [, column2, ...])
);

2. Alter
-------
The ALTER command is used to modify the structure of an existing database object (most commonly a table).

What ALTER Can Do:
------------------
Add Columns:
You can add one or more columns to an existing table without affecting existing data.

Modify Columns:
Change the datatype, size, or nullability of an existing column. Note that certain modifications might be restricted if data already exists.

Drop Columns:
Remove columns that are no longer needed. This operation permanently deletes the column and its data.

Rename Columns or Tables:
Starting with Oracle 9i, you can rename a column in a table or rename the table itself.

Manage Constraints:
Add or drop constraints (e.g., primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints) as needed.

Syntax:
------
ALTER TABLE table_name
ADD column_name datatype;

3. Drop
------
Permanently removes an object (or objects) and all associated data from the database.
Once executed, changes are auto-committed, meaning the object cannot be recovered (except via backup).

What Drop Can Do:
---------------
Tables:
Removes an entire table along with its data.

Views:
Removes a view used to present data from one or more tables.

dexes:
Deletes indexes created for performance optimization.

Sequences:
Removes sequences used for generating unique numbers.

Synonyms:
Deletes alternative names for database objects.

Stored Procedures/Functions/Packages:
Removes PL/SQL objects like procedures, functions, or packages.

Triggers:
Removes triggers that automatically execute DML operations.

4. Truncate
-----------
Removes all rows from a table while preserving the table structure for future use.

Syntax:
------
TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;
